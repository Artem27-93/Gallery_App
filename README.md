    Information about project:

**In this project - "Gallery"- I wrote a code that returns information about films from an open database(The Movie Database (TMDb)).

**Each component is an independent block with content, which has a button to remove the movie from the page, and a button to add to "favorites".

**There are also working filter buttons that sort the list of films by rating and popularity.
At this stage, the application is in development status.
